#LIFE: Don't worry so much about what other people think of you,
#focus on your words and actions. People remember when you encourage them
#and support them, and that is what they will love you for. And
#you don't do it for their love, you do it because you love them.
#That will bring you social fulfillment far more than fitting in.

Why do gurus talk about ego(self)? Why do spiritualists teach us that we
are all one?
 Well, it is because it is the ego that feels pain, that hurts and struggles.
 The truth here is, until we understand that we are not our ego,
 that our "self" is not who we are, we cannot grasp that everything is
 truly okay. It is not until you become self aware that you are your
 soul before you understand that you are okay. That everything is okay.
  Always.
